# ReWiringJava8
Revising Java 8

Why Java 8 ?
-------------
1. Supports functional programming
   1. embraces creating immutable objects
   2. more concise and readable
   3. allows passing of functions as a method parameters
   4. declarative way of writing code
      1. We are only worried about the result not the algorithm behind it.
         1. Ex: SQl quires
2. Effective utilization of system resources
   1. provides many concurrent libraries
   2. parallel streams

Declarative VS Imperative
-------------------------
   1. Imperative
      1. Immutable objects
         1. can result in problems while running in multithreaded environment
      2. Not Readable Code
   2. Declarative
      1. Logic is abstracted
         1. Don't worry about how it is done
      2. More readable
   
   Note : Examples are present in ImperativeDeclarative Package
